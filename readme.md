<h4>Guideline for Running the System:</h4>
<p>To run this system on a local PHP server, follow these steps:</p>

<h4>Server Setup:</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Ensure you have a local PHP development environment set up. You can use tools like XAMPP, WAMP, or MAMP to install PHP, Apache, and MySQL on your local machine.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Database Setup:</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Create a MySQL database to store student and attendance data. Design tables to store information about students, courses, attendance, and other relevant data.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Backend Development:</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Develop PHP scripts to handle data input, processing, and storage.</li>
    <li>Implement functionality for date selection, department selection, semester selection, etc.</li>
    <li>Create endpoints for submitting and retrieving attendance data.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Frontend Development:</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Develop a user-friendly web interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</li>
    <li>Create forms for date selection, department selection, and other inputs.</li>
    <li>Design pages for displaying attendance reports and marking systems.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Database Integration:</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Connect your PHP scripts to the MySQL database. Implement data retrieval and storage mechanisms for attendance and student information.</li>
</ul>

Create a MySQL database to store student and attendance data. Design tables to store information about students, courses, attendance, and other relevant data.

<h4>Backend Development:</h4>

Develop PHP scripts to handle data input, processing, and storage. Implement functionality for date selection, department selection, semester selection, etc. Create endpoints for submitting and retrieving attendance data.

<h4>Frontend Development:</h4>

Develop a user-friendly web interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Create forms for date selection, department selection, and other inputs. Design pages for displaying attendance reports and marking systems.

<h4>Database Integration:</h4>

Connect your PHP scripts to the MySQL database. Implement data retrieval and storage mechanisms for attendance and student information.
